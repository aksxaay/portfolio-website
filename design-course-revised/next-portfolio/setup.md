### next-portfolio

Setup Explained.
For some reason running the starter with-tailwindcss on next gives us a typescript project??
which was only supposed to happen with `--typescript` flag.

installed
`npx @eslint/config`
it is to enforce code style..
the most popular one being air-bnb

setting up auto-format with prettier

[typescript-eslint-prettier-tailwindcss](https://www.sandromaglione.com/create-nextjs-project-with-typescript-eslint-prettier-tailwindcss/)
this is a decent project setup.

I also forked a couple boilerplate code on github, that hopefully has all the solutions to my problems.

ESLint + Airbnb Styleguide.


well you have to mention the allowed domains it can go out of..
so I have to add unsplash to the list of allowed domains.
