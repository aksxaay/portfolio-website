### Intro

but basically we're trying to hook the react application to the `index.html`?


```
ReactDOM.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('root'));
```
what is this?
there's only one div with `id='root'`
this is where the entire react application goes.

clear up the HTML file

> create `App.js`
run `rafce`
React arrow function component.


download and install `es7 snippets`

for some reason you can't bracket ReactDOM as 
`{ReactDOM}`

oh react has hot-reloading by default.
